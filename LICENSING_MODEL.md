# LinkedIn Gateway Licensing Model

## Overview

LinkedIn Gateway follows a **"fair-code"** licensing model, similar to n8n's approach, using the **Sustainable Use License (SUL)**. This model balances open collaboration with commercial sustainability.

## What is Fair-Code?

Fair-code is a source-available licensing model that:
- Makes the source code freely available
- Allows free use, modification, and self-hosting
- Restricts certain commercial uses to ensure project sustainability
- Is **NOT** considered "open source" by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) definition

## License: Sustainable Use License
